# GoZen Lite

GoZen Lite is a video player made in Godot together with the [GoZen GDExtension](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gozen_gdextension). The goal of this lite version of GoZen is to serve as a type of test room for the full GoZen version. This does not mean that GoZen Lite won't be useable. My goal for GoZen lite is to become a very lightweight and minimal video editor which can run on nearly all hardware. The biggest difference between this version and the full version will be that this version won't be able to be extended with plugins/modules and the full version will be.

To stay up to date of the progress on GoZen Lite check out [this issue](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gde_gozen/issues/1).

## Setting up the project

First of all create a folder in the main project folder called `gde_gozen` and copy the bin files from [GoZen GDExtension](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gde_gozen) into that folder. If something does not work check if the paths line up in the gozen.gdextension file. 

After that we will also need a folder called `gde_data_manager` and copy the bin files from [gde_data_manager repo](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gde_data_manager) inside of that folder. Same as for the GoZen gde, check if the paths line up with the paths inside of the data_manager.gdextension file.
