# Gozen Lite

Video player in Godot with FFmpeg

## Part 1

In part 1 of the tutorial series we only setup the project structure and the basic layout inside of the Godot project. We also created a git repository.

## Part 2

In part 2 we set-up the GDExtension and created a basic class which we can access from Godot.
